# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Data Aggregation" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to start the challenge. I still struggle to understand how to apply acquired knowledge in real-life problems so I think I need to start some project (but have now ideas where to begin). Finally used to read the docs!

### Day 2: March 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Combining Data With Pandas" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest.

**Thoughts:** I understood almost everything, but was quite tired today, so I need to refresh my memory tomorrow. I'd like to explore some real-life data with the methods, I've learnt today.


### Day 3: March 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Transforming Data With Pandas" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest. Also learn the pivot function by experimenting with the arguments, it wasn't that diffucult as it'd seemed initially.

**Thoughts:** I was happy to understand how pivot tables are powerful, I'm also very proud of myself for understanding how to use the pivot function. Have to apply this knowledge to some other dataset to practice a bit. 


### Day 4: March 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Working With Strings In Pandas" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest. Regex are quite difficult to undestand. 

**Thoughts:** I need to practice much more and try to understand what the docs say! Also have to read more carefully what I have to do in the exercise. I'm very happy that I can stay on track with the challegne, it's actually encouraging to write my thoughts on Twitter and Github.


### Day 5: March 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I'm on half way of "Working With Missing And Duplicate Data" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest.

**Thoughts:** I had to split my 1 hour in two parts today. The exercises weren't diffucult but I would like to figure out another method to fill missing values from another dataset.


### Day 6: March 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did some practice exercises on Dataquest.

**Thoughts:** I had to revise some base concepts, because I studied them some months ago, so it was very useful to get to basics.

### Day 7: March 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued with my Facebook ADs project. Today I cleaned a bit the code, but got some problems with Google API access. Ready to resolve everything tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** I'm determined to finish the project in the next few days. Finally I will have all my data automatically uploaded on Google Sheets.

### Day 8: March 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started to analyse the internship dataset.

**Thoughts:** It's incredible how things I studied turn to be useful! I had to apply a lot of cleaning and exploratory techniques. I will continue to learn much more.


### Day 9: March 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued to explore the dataset. Got some problems while transforming the coordinates columns in float values, need more investigaiton. Also have to understand better Geopandas.

**Thoughts:** The more I explore the dataset, the more I learn. Working on a project is actually very useful. But I got distracted by some tutorials that I didn't need at the moment.
