# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Data Aggregation" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to start the challenge. I still struggle to understand how to apply acquired knowledge in real-life problems so I think I need to start some project (but have now ideas where to begin). Finally used to read the docs!

### Day 2: March 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Combining Data with Pandas" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest.

**Thoughts:** I understood almost everything, but was quite tired today, so I need to refresh my memory tomorrow. I'd like to explore some real-life data with the methods, I've learnt today.
