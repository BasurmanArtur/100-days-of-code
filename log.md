# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Data Aggregation" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to start the challenge. I still struggle to understand how to apply acquired knowledge in real-life problems so I think I need to start some project (but have now ideas where to begin). Finally used to read the docs!

### Day 2: March 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Combining Data With Pandas" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest.

**Thoughts:** I understood almost everything, but was quite tired today, so I need to refresh my memory tomorrow. I'd like to explore some real-life data with the methods, I've learnt today.


### Day 3: March 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Transforming Data With Pandas" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest. Also learn the pivot function by experimenting with the arguments, it wasn't that diffucult as it'd seemed initially.

**Thoughts:** I was happy to understand how pivot tables are powerful, I'm also very proud of myself for understanding how to use the pivot function. Have to apply this knowledge to some other dataset to practice a bit. 


### Day 4: March 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Working With Strings In Pandas" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest. Regex are quite difficult to undestand. 

**Thoughts:** I need to practice much more and try to understand what the docs say! Also have to read more carefully what I have to do in the exercise. I'm very happy that I can stay on track with the challegne, it's actually encouraging to write my thoughts on Twitter and Github.
