# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Data Aggregation" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to start the challenge. I still struggle to understand how to apply acquired knowledge in real-life problems so I think I need to start some project (but have now ideas where to begin). Finally used to read the docs!
