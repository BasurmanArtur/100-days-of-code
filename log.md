# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Data Aggregation" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to start the challenge. I still struggle to understand how to apply acquired knowledge in real-life problems so I think I need to start some project (but have now ideas where to begin). Finally used to read the docs!

### Day 2: March 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Combining Data With Pandas" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest.

**Thoughts:** I understood almost everything, but was quite tired today, so I need to refresh my memory tomorrow. I'd like to explore some real-life data with the methods, I've learnt today.


### Day 3: March 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Transforming Data With Pandas" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest. Also learn the pivot function by experimenting with the arguments, it wasn't that diffucult as it'd seemed initially.

**Thoughts:** I was happy to understand how pivot tables are powerful, I'm also very proud of myself for understanding how to use the pivot function. Have to apply this knowledge to some other dataset to practice a bit. 


### Day 4: March 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished "Working With Strings In Pandas" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest. Regex are quite difficult to undestand. 

**Thoughts:** I need to practice much more and try to understand what the docs say! Also have to read more carefully what I have to do in the exercise. I'm very happy that I can stay on track with the challegne, it's actually encouraging to write my thoughts on Twitter and Github.


### Day 5: March 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I'm on half way of "Working With Missing And Duplicate Data" from the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course on Dataquest.

**Thoughts:** I had to split my 1 hour in two parts today. The exercises weren't diffucult but I would like to figure out another method to fill missing values from another dataset.


### Day 6: March 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did some practice exercises on Dataquest.

**Thoughts:** I had to revise some base concepts, because I studied them some months ago, so it was very useful to get to basics.

### Day 7: March 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued with my Facebook ADs project. Today I cleaned a bit the code, but got some problems with Google API access. Ready to resolve everything tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** I'm determined to finish the project in the next few days. Finally I will have all my data automatically uploaded on Google Sheets.

### Day 8: March 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started to analyse the internship dataset.

**Thoughts:** It's incredible how things I studied turn to be useful! I had to apply a lot of cleaning and exploratory techniques. I will continue to learn much more.


### Day 9: March 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued to explore the dataset. Got some problems while transforming the coordinates columns in float values, need more investigaiton. Also have to understand better Geopandas.

**Thoughts:** The more I explore the dataset, the more I learn. Working on a project is actually very useful. But I got distracted by some tutorials that I didn't need at the moment. 



### Day 10: March 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued to explore the dataset. I still can't convert the coordinates in an appropriate format.

**Thoughts:** I have to ask on StackOverflow how to converts the coordinate to floats!


### Day 11: March 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to revise and finish "Working With Missing And Duplicate Data" on Dataquest.

**Thoughts:** I start to learn a lot of in-built pandas methods to accomplish the word, I'd done manually before. It feels exciting!

### Day 12: March 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished "Working With Missing And Duplicate Data" on Dataquest and actually restarted my internship project with new instruments I have now.

**Thoughts:** I'm very excited about data analysis. I'm ready to tackle every problem I will have and to learn even more data analysis tecniques!


### Day 13: March 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continue my internship project. I got a lot of problems while cleaning the dataset (especially converting numeric strings to floats), so tomorrow I will have to start over.

**Thoughts:** That's was quite difficult, I cannot undestand where I'm making a mistake, so tomorrow I'm ready to find it out. 


### Day 14: March 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work with the internship dataset, trying to convert coordinates in float numbers, but didn't succeed for God knows which reason.

**Thoughts:** That's tough, the code that did work some days ago today doesn't work at all. Have to figure it out. 


### Day 15: March 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I finally was able to convert coordinate in float numbers. The problem was with the  ```regex=False ``` in  ```replace()``` function. Then I converted the coordinates in Point of geopandas and plotted all coordinates on Asia-Europe map.

**Thoughts:** It was a great pleasure after days of trying to finally did what I was expecting!


### Day 16: March 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I converted all coordinates in ```shapely.Point``` objects and plotted them on an Asia-Europe map. Also I calculated an arbitrary distance from a point to each of coordinates.   

**Thoughts:** Days of work have finally got me to a satisfying result. Now it's time to further analyse the dataset and try to find any patterns in human mighrations. 

### Day 17: March 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I tried to create a plot that puts in relation average age of human samples and distance from an arbitrary point on the map. Found out that there's no analogue of ```geom_smooth()``` from R in Python. So tomorrow I will download ggplot for Python.

**Thoughts:** More I dive into coding more I understand how much more I have to learn and understand. But I'm excited to continue my path!

### Day 18: March 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I found out that ggplot is only for Python 3.6, but I also discovered that I can do a lot of stuff I want with Seaborn. I also read some interesting tutorials on how to work with Excel tables.

**Thoughts:** I'd like to learn further about Seaborn, it seems to be a powerful data visualization instrument. 


### Day 19: March 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to rest a bit from the internship project and commited myself to doing a small WhatsApp chats analyzer. Got some interesting insights in one of my group. I used [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-your-own-whatsapp-chat-analyzer-9590acca9014) to actually copy-paste the code, but also trying to understand what it means. I was able to understand everything, even though it wasn't easy.

**Thoughts:** I have to be more independent while building my projects.


### Day 20: March 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I revised "my" project and understood it a bit better. Also I tried to use regex to extract all emojis. Somehow it worked, but I'd like to count them.

**Thoughts:** From tomorrow I'll try to write my own functions, maybe doing a guided project on Dataquest.


### Day 21: March 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Since due to the coronavirus, it's not clear if the internship will continue I decided to begin a guided project on Dataquest. Today I did some initial exploration of the datasets.

**Thoughts:** I'm determined to ask to the initial questions about the dataset and also to write my observations in clear way.

### Day 22: March 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I did some data exploration of exit surveys of Australian TAFE e DETE on Dataquest. These datasets present similar data, but require a lot of data cleaning. I'm ready to start on working!

**Thoughts:** I'm excited about starting a real data science project!

### Day 23: March 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued the data exploration and made some interesting observations. Unfortunately I wasn't attentive enough to notice some missing data in two columns and had to read it from the Dataquest tutorial.

**Thoughts:** I have to pay much more attention while exploring the data to avoid unwanted mistakes during the analysis.

### Day 24: March 30, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the initial data explorarion and started to clean the data.

**Thoughts:** I didn't do that much today, but I understand that is one of the most important parts of any data analysis so I have to master data cleaning!


### Day 25: March 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I removed the unnecessary columns and renamed some columns to standartize both datasets. I also did some easy exercises to review basic concepts of Python like lists.

**Thoughts:** 1/4 of way passed, the time runs so fast!


### Day 26: April 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to clean the datasets. Had to use regex to extract some data, but didn't find out how to assign it back to pandas `DataFrame`.

**Thoughts:** I slowly proceed, learning a lot of new things. Surely the hardest task is to search for the information I need.

### Day 27: April 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I did exercises on frequency tables on DataQuest.

**Thoughts:** How easily they can be made with `group_by()` from pandas! I didn't come up with a solution using just for loops.

### Day 28: April 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I had quite a busy day, so I decided to continue with the exercises. Come up with a solution to the yesterday exercise, but got stuck in another one.

**Thoughts:** Doing such exercises helps to refresh memory on basic Python concepts, and they are actually not that easy to solve as this may seem, so I was in constant reading through docs and StackOverflow.

### Day 29: April 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work on a Guided Project on Dataquest. Learnt quite a lot about vectorized string methods in Python.

**Thoughts:** My work slowly continues, overcoming quite a few obstacles on my way, but it is very satisfactory when you finally do what you wanted.


### Day 30: April 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work on a Guided Project on Dataquest. Tried to plot some boxplots and got some key errors on DataQuest, although everything worked fine on my local machine. Gotta ask the community about the problem tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Incredible! One month passed so quickly.


### Day 31: April 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work on a Guided Project on Dataquest. Asked about the yesterday problem on Community forum, waiting for a response. I started to create new columns by combining the existing ones. Learnt about `DataFrame.any()` method.

**Thoughts:** On March 6 I started this challenge, only missed one day of coding. That result would be impossible wityout the challenge. 

### Day 32: April 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work on a Guided Project on Dataquest. I finally combined both datasets, dropped all unnecessary columns and tomorrow I will start a real analysis.

**Thoughts:** I am at the final stage of the project, excited to see what I will find out!


### Day 33: April 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work on a Guided Project on Dataquest. I finished initial data cleaning and finally got an answer to the first question, using a plot:

* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?

From the initial analysis it is clear that empoyees with more than 7 years of service are more likely to resign due to some kind of dissatisfaction.

Tomorrow I will continue to clean the datasets and answer to the second question. I will also improve aesthetics of all plots I will create with Seaborn.

**Thoughts:** It needs a lot of mental work in order to answer data science questions, but when you get the result, is is so much satisfation!


### Day 34: April 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work on a Guided Project on Dataquest. I improved the plot mastering my Seaborn skills, I also cleaned a bit the code and Markup description.

**Thoughts:** That was a great satisfaction get a cleaner plot, that visualizes my data much clearer.

### Day 35: April 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work on a Guided Project on Dataquest. I splitted all the employees in generational cohorts and plotted a bar plot. The Gen Z is the most satisfied generation!

**Thoughts:** Today I finally did some independent work, even though not completely. I have to take over a project and start ot do it independently.

### Day 36: April 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work on a Guided Project on Dataquest. I created a pivot table combining service categories and generation cohorts, then I reordered to make it more logical, I also reordered the previous pivot tables. Finally, I plotted the results.

**Thoughts:** Today I worked independently, searching for information on Web, that was incredible!


### Day 37: April 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I just wrote a quick function that annotates all my plots because DRY!

**Thoughts:** I didn't work a lot today, because of Easter, but I believe my project is almost ready. I have to write some conclusions, check the code, typos. I also have to check for any bias in the data. Happy Easter!

### Day 38: April 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I read thouroughly my project, correcting mistakes, style inconsistencies, illogical passages and so on.

**Thoughts:** I'm almost ready to publish my project. Just need to check for biases, typos, align it with the [DataQuest style guide](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-project-style-guide/) and write conclusions.

### Day 39: April 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I checked if each group is big enough to provide attendible data. It is clear that some groups are too small to be sure that conclusions are correct.

**Thoughts:** This thought to check for any bias got into my mind last night, and actually it was very important to check for data biases. Now I need to align the project with DataQuest style guide.

### Day 40: April 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I finalized my project. Tomorrow I am going to read a [DataQuest style guide](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-project-style-guide/) to check if I may improve anything.

**Thoughts:** I am on the verge tof publishing my project! I'd like to have any feedback that may improve my skills (especially writing).


### Day 41: April 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I improved the project style, making some small changes to the plots, subheadings and the title.

**Thoughts**: I finally uploaded my project and asked for any feedback on DataQuest forums.


### Day 42: April 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I tried to do a small exercise on dictionaries but failed because I couldn't even understand the logic to use behind it. After looking at the solution, I slowly figured out what had to be done.

**Thoughts**: It is completely ok to check the solution if I fully understand what is the idea behind it.

### Day 43: April 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started to study regex on DataQuest, I already knew the basics, so it wasn't difficult to understand basic stuff.

**Thoughts**: Yesterday my project was recognized as one of the best this week, I'm very proud and happy!

### Day 44: April 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to study regex on DataQuest. It took me numerous attempts to solve the challenge, but I finally did it and learned some useful case studies. 

**Thoughts**: Most of work is already done before us, so it has no sense to reinvent the wheel, but it is important to fully understand the code that we copy.


### Day 45: April 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to study regex on DataQuest. It took me half an hour to figure out a regex to extract all URLs from the [HackerNews dataset](https://news.ycombinator.com).

**Thoughts**: I still not fully understand the syntax behind this pattern, but I will try to understand it!


### Day 46: April 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I restarted my internship project, I combined two datasets and splitted all ages in diffent categories. I also did some exercise on regex on DataQuest and extracted separately URL's protocol, domain and page path. I failed though not to return non-matches.

**Thoughts**: It is great to restart my internship but I still struggle to understand next steps.

### Day 47: April 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started "List Comprehensions and Lambda Functions" on DataQuest.

**Thoughts**: List Comprehensions make me feel free from for loops, a great tool discovered too late!

### Day 48: April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about `lambda` functions on DataQuest.

**Thoughts**: I already knew what `lambda` functions are but the way they are explained on DataQuest is incredibly simple and understandable!

### Day 49: April 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about the `DataFrame.mask()` method and correlation heatmaps. 

**Thoughts**: I'm definitely interested in producing beautiful plots!

### Day 50: April 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I mastered the `DataFrame.mask()` method cleaning a [NYC dataset Vehicle Collisions](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95).

**Thoughts**: I'm on halfway of the challenge, that is and incredible achievement!

### Day 51: April 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I almost finished "Data Cleaning Walkthrough" on DataQuest.

**Thoughts**: This mission helps me understand a general data science workflow. Things get complicated, and also the datasets I'm analyzing are not particularly interesting.

### Day 52: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished "Data Cleaning Walkthrough: Combining the Data" on DataQuest. I combined several datasets using different merge types: left or inner based on what I needed from the final dataset. I also applied new knowledge to clean my internship datasets.

**Thoughts**: Today I noticed that I actually know quite a lot, now I just need to practice a lot in order to master and polish my skills (I'm still not very quick in deciding what to do next).


### Day 53: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished "Data Cleaning Walkthrough: Analyzing and Visualizing Data" on DataQuest. I visualized some interesting data on a NYC map.

**Thoughts**: Tomorrow I will start a new guided project on NYC Sat Scores. I will try to find out if this test is fair to different groups of high schools seniors.


### Day 54: April 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started a new guided project on DataQuest. I will analyse NYC Sat Scores and find out if this test if fair to different demographic groups. I will also try to figure out if there are any correlations with school satisfaction scores.

**Thoughts**: Ready to rock with this new project!

### Day 55: April 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked a lot on my internship project, mainly cleaning the samples' names in order to effectively combine two datasets.

**Thoughts**: I'm almost ready to begin with analyzing and visualizing of the data.

### Day 56: May 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work on the guided project on DataQuest. I cleaned a bit all datasets and wrote some markdown notes to explain every step I accomplish.

**Thoughts**: Now the process of data cleaning seems much more natural than just a couple of weeks ago.


### Day 57: May 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked a lot on my internship project and finally plotted all ancient human samples on two maps based on their average ages and age categories.

**Thoughts**: It was very exciting to search for information to solve a lot of challenges along the way!


### Day 58: May 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work on the guided project on DataQuest. I didn't get why we use different join methods when combining the datasets and had to ask for it on the forum.

**Thoughts**: Just waiting for an answer, I'm glad I decided to pay more attention to motivations behind join methods.

### Day 59: May 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work on the guided project on DataQuest. I calculated correlations between SAT results and some demographic school measures.

**Thoughts**: I found some surprising correlations, like the fact that bigger schools perform better in the SAT!

### Day 60: May 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on my internship project and learn a bit more about Basemap, I also experimented a bit with multiple maps on the same plot, but they were too big to put them in one picture so I decided to plot them one by one.

**Thoughts**: I'm excited because I have to correlate DNA percentage with sample age and plot them on the map, that will be a great challenge! 


### Day 61: May 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the guided project on DataQuest. I learned a lot about visualizing technique and I'm eager to experiment with Seaborn!

**Thoughts**: Data Visualizing is extremely appealing to me. 


### Day 62: May 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the guided project on DataQuest. I tried to find out how to gain full controll of individual ticks and probably have some ideas that I have to check in the next days.

**Thoughts**: There is so much functionatlity in Matplotlib if you are willing to dig deeper!

### Day 63: May 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the guided project on DataQuest. I mapped school safety scores on the map and customized it a bit. 

**Thoughts**: Plot customization is very exciting!

### Day 64: May 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the guided project on DataQuest. I found out that the black ethnicity group study in less safest schools. I have to investigate further the correlation between percentage of the hispanic group and SAT scores.

**Thoughts**: I did some cool plot customizations! That was very exciting!

### Day 65: May 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the guided project on DataQuest. I found out that the English learners percentage correlates negatively with average SAT scores.

**Thoughts**: It was very interesting to search for information on Google to understand the causes of correlations I've found.

### Day 66: May 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the guided project on DataQuest. I improved the aesthetics of plots and found out that there is only a small possibility of gender correlation with SAT results. Academic preparation is much more important in students' performance.

**Thoughts**: I have to be quicker in finishing the projects. I know try to figure out what are the best plots to use and to learn some new customization techniques that I will use in my next projects.

### Day 67: May 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the guided project on DataQuest. I found out that schools with bigger average class sizes perform better in the SAT! I also learned how to use LaTex in the Matplotlib annotation.

**Thoughts**: I still find small flaws in my plots, probably I have to appreciate what I did so far?

### Day 68: May 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the guided project on DataQuest. I checked and corrected some logical and grammar errors. I also renamed most titles to make them more meaningful. In the next few days I will write conclusions and publish my project on DataQuest community forums. 

**Thoughts**: I am excited that I am improving so much!

### Day 69: May 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I wrote conclusions and results of my project and published it on the DataQuest forums.

**Thoughts**: I'm waiting for feedback: especially on my plots!

### Day 70: May 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I did "Challenge: Cleaning Data". I struggled in one challenge but than figured out how to do them by looking at the answer (and understanding it).

**Thoughts**: I still can't resolve some challenging tasks. It sucks but I'm improving! Tomorrow I will start a new guided project analyzing the Star Wars Surveys.
